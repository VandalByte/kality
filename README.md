# ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About
Kality is a somewhat decent package manager I developed in C++ that can download the required tools from Kali Linux repository into any Debian system without any hassle. Feel free to give it a try!

There's also a [TODO](https://github.com/VandalByte/kality/blob/main/TODO.md) file where I've outlined plans to further optimize this tool, so feel free to check it out. If you're interested in contributing, well that's really great, check out the [contributing](https://github.com/VandalByte/kality/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines to know more.

<span style="color:red"><b>IMPORTANT</b></span> ‚ûú You should try it out in a virtual machine (VM) first, it's usually fine, there's still a 1% chance it could mess up your system. Just a heads up.

```

# üöÄ Compilation and Installation

First, clone the kality repository and navigate into it.

You're all set! Check it out.
