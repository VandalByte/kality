### ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About
Kality is a somewhat decent package manager I developed that can download the required tools from Kali Linux repository into any Debian system without any hassle.

Feel free to give it a try! For those wondering why it's written in C++ instead of Python, well, I just felt like it. There's also a [TODO](https://github.com/VandalByte/kality/blob/main/TODO.md) file where I've outlined plans to further optimize this tool, so feel free to check it out. If you're interested in contributing, well that will be really great.

<span style="color:red"><b>IMPORTANT</b></span> ‚ûú You should try it out in a virtual machine (VM) first, it's usually fine, there's still a 1% chance it could mess up your system. Just a heads up.

### üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites
To compile and to ensure proper working of the script, you need to have the following packages installed on your system:
```bash
sudo apt install g++ make wget
```

### üöÄ Compilation and Installation

First, clone the kality repository and navigate into it.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/VandalByte/kality.git
```
Now, compile the code and place the binary file in `/usr/local/bin/` for system-wide access.
```bash
sudo g++ kality.cpp -o /usr/local/bin/kality
```
Now, give executable permission to the file.
```bash
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kality
```
Now run the update to install the keyring to the system.
```bash
kality update
```
You're all set! Check it out.


### üìã How to use?
For the current release you can install, remove and update packages with kality.

This will undo the changes done by kality, but the packages you installed will still be there, so remember to uninstall them first.
```bash
kality purge
```

### üí° What's Next?

I'm still trying to finish up my TODO list and add the rest of the functions.
