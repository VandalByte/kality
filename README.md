 A Kali Linux package management tool for Debian systems
```

### 🤷‍♂️ About
So I'm sure you're wondering what this is. It's a somewhat decent package manager I developed because, when I started with cybersecurity, I wanted a clean OS build with only essential packages. Initially, I had to manually download each package since they weren't available in the Debian repository, which was quite tedious. Eventually, I got the idea to integrate the Kali repository into Debian. Everyone in every forum said it was a terrible idea, but I had to try, and this is what I came up with. I'm not saying it's a work of art but it gets the job done.

Feel free to give it a try! For those wondering why it's written in C++ instead of Python, well, I just felt like it. There's also a TODO file where I've outlined plans to further optimize this tool, so feel free to check it out. If you're interested in contributing, your help would be greatly appreciated.

**PS:** I really think you should try it out in a virtual machine (VM). While it's usually fine, there's still a 1% chance it could mess up your system. Just a heads up, don't blame me if something goes wrong. I'll deny it.

### 🛠️ Prerequisites
To compile and to ensure proper working of the script, you need to have the following packages installed on your system:
```bash
sudo apt install g++ make wget
```
